# MIPSIM

This is a suite of simulators for a limited subset of the MIPS32 ISA. It includes:

1. A cycle-accurate instruction level simulator
1. A timing simulator

This project is derived from [CMU 18-447][course_link]'s labs. The shells have been used as-is. The simulator cores have been created from scratch.
